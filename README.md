## 🌱 About Me

I’m a student deeply interested in **computer science, problem-solving, and building technology that creates real-world impact**. My journey started with curiosity — experimenting with small programs — and grew into a passion for **algorithms, software engineering, and machine learning**.

Over time, I’ve worked on projects ranging from **desktop applications** to **machine learning models**, and I enjoy moving between theory and practice — whether that’s analyzing time complexity, designing clean abstractions, or turning an idea into working code.

I’m especially interested in how **technology can be used to improve access, efficiency, and opportunity**, particularly in under-resourced communities.
