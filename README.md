## 🌱 About Me

I’m currently an undergraduate Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I've been programming in various languages for about 5 years now. I've always been deeply interested in exploring how **computer science and mathematics** can be used to create practical solutions to real-world problems. 

I love exploring a wide range of topics beside just programming,
